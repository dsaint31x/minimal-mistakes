# Electrostatics (정전기)
@(Physics)[#electorcity ]

## Summary of Terms

* Electricity(전기)
   * A general term for electrical phenomena,
   * much like *gravity* has to do with graviational phenomena.

* Electrostatics(정전기)
   * The study of **electric charge(전하)** at rest ( not *in motion*, as in electric currents).

* Convervative of charge(전하보존의 법칙)
   * Electric charge is neither created nor destroyed.
   * The total charge before an interaction equals the total charge after.

* Coulomb's law(1785, Coulomb)
   * The relationship among electrical force, charge, and distance:
   $$
F=k\frac{q_1 q_2}{d^2}
$$
   * If the charges are alike in sign, the force is repulsive;
   * if the charges are unlike, the force is attractive.

* Coulomb
   * The SI unit of electric charge.
   * One coulomb (symbol **C**) is equal to the total charge of $6.25 \times 10^{18}$ electrons.

* Conductor(도체)
   * Any material that has **free charged particles (,commonly free electrons),** easily flow through it
   * when an electrical force acts on them.

* Insulator(부도체,절연체)
   * A materials that does not contain free charged particles and through which charge does not easily flow.

* Semiconductor(반도체)
   * A materials with properties that fall between those of a conductor and an insulator and 
   * whose resistance can be affected by adding impurities.

* Superconductor(초전도체)
   * A materials that is a perfect conductor with **zero resistance** to the flow of electric charge.

* Charging(대전) by contact
   * The transfer of electric charges b/w objects by rubbing or simple touching.

* Charging(대전) by induction(유도)
   * The redistibution of electric charges in and on objects cuase by the electrical influence of a charged object close by but no in contact.

* Electrically polarized(전기편극, 분극)
   * The term applied to an atom or molecules in which the chages are aligned so that one side has a slight excess of positive charge and the other side a slight excess of negative charge.

* Electric field(전기장)
   * Electrical force per unit of charge.
   * The field can be considered to be an **aura** surrounding charged objects and
   * is a storehouse of electric enegy.
   * About a charged point, the field decreaseswith distance according to the **inverse-square law**, like a graviational field.
   * B/w oppositely charged parallel plates, the electic field si uniform: Electric Field = $\frac{F}{q}$

* Electirc potential energy
   * The enegy a charged object possesses by virtue of its location in an electric field.

* Electric potential(전위)
   * The electic potential energy per unit of charge,
   * measured in volts;
   * often called *voltage*:
   $$
V = \frac{\text{electric potential energy}}{\text{charge}}
$$

* Capacitor(축전기)
   * An electrical device that stores electic charge and energy.
   * Its simplest form is pair of parallel conducting plates separated by a small distance.
