# Colossians 1:27-29

to whom God willed to make known what the ealth of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles is, *the mystery* that is Christ in you, the hope of glory.
We proclaim Him, admonishing every person and teaching every person with all wisdom, so that we may present every person complete in Christ. 
For this purpose I also labor, striving according to His power which works mightily within me.
																															Colossians 1:27-29
