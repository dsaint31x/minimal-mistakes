# Psalms 85:4-9

Restore us, God of our salvation, 
And cause Your indignation toward us to cease. 

Will You be angry with us forever? 
Will You prolong Your anger to all generations? 

Will You not revive us again, 
So that Your people may rejoice in You? 

Show us Your mercy, LORD, 
And grant us Your salvation. 

I will hear what God the LORD will say; 
For He will speak peace to His people, to His godly ones; 
And may they not turn back to foolishness. 

Certainly His salvation is near to those who fear Him, 
That glory may dwell in our land.
