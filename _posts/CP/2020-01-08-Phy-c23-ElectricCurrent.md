# Electric current (전류)
@(Physics)[#current]

## Summary of Terms

* Electric potential difference(전위차)
   * The difference in electric potential b/w two points,
   * measured in volts.
   * synonymous with *voltage difference* or simply *voltage*.
> 결국 위치에너지로서, 1C의 charge가 electric field에서 이동할 때 1J의 Energy를 잃거나 얻을때, 이동시작점과 끝지점의 electric potential difference가 1v임.
> graviational field의 mass에 해당하는게 charge라고 생각할 수 있음.

* Electric current(전류)
   * The flow of electric charge that transports energy from one place to another,
      * current에 의해 열효과, 전자기효과, 화학 효과가 발생.(energy가 일을 함).
         * 열효과 : Joule's law (Q발열량 = $0.24i^2Rt$)
         * 전자기효과 : current는 magnetic field의 변화를 일으킴 (Lentz's law)
         * 화학적효과 : battery의 emf
   * measured in *amperes*,
   * where 1A is the flow of $6.25 \times 10^{18}$ electrons per seconds,
   * or **1 coulomb per second**.


* Electric resistance (저항)
   * Teh property of a material that resists electric current, 
   * measuerd in ohms ($\Omega$).

* Ohm's law
   * The statement that the current in a circuit varies 
       * in direct proportion to the potential difference or voltage across the circuit and 
       * inversely with the circuit's resistance:
   $$
I=\frac{\text{voltage}}{\text{resistance}}
$$
   * A potential difference of 1V across a resistnace of 1$\Omega$ produces a current of 1A.

* Direct current(직류) 
   * Electrically charged particles flowing in one direction only.

* Alternating current(교류)
   * Electrically charged particels that repeatedly reverse direction,
      * vibrating about relatively fixed positions
   * In the Korea, the vibrational rate is commonly 60Hz.

* Electric power(전력)
   * The rate of energy transfer, or
   * the rate of doing work;
   * the amount of enrgy per unit time, 
   * which can be computed as the product of current and voltage:
   $$
\text{Power} = \text{current} \times \text{voltage}
$$
   * Electric power is measured in watts (or kilowatts), where
   * 1W = 1A $\times$ 1V = 1 J/s.

* Series circuit(직렬 회로)
   * An electric circuit in which electrical devices are connected along a single loop of wire 
   * such that the same current is in each device.

* Parallel circuit(병렬 회로)
   * An electric circuit in which electrical devices are connected in such a wya that the same voltage acts across each one,
   * and any single one completes the circuit independently of all the others.

* Electromotive force
   * electron에 운동에너지를 공급하여, circuit에서 current가 계속해서 유지되도록 하는 능력.
   * 역학적/화학적 에너지에 의해 electric potential difference를 계속해서 만들어내는 source의 능력을 가르킴.
   * souce는 emf를 가지고 있어서 charge를 낮은 electric potential 에서 높은 electric potnetial로 만들어냄.
   * enrgy per unit charge!
   * 화학적 에너지에 의한 emf : Nernst equation (이온들의 농도 차에 의해 기전력 발생. 1889 Nernst)
